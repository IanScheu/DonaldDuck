How to Read Donald Duck (Spanish: Para leer al Pato Donald) is a 1971 book-length essay by Ariel Dorfman and Armand Mattelart that critiques Disney comics from a Marxist point of view as being vehicles for American cultural imperialism. It was first published in Chile in 1971, became a bestseller throughout Latin America[1] and is still considered a seminal work in cultural studies.[2] It was reissued in August 2018 to a general audience in the United States, with a new introduction by Dorfman, by OR Books.

### General

The book's thesis is thatÂ [Disney comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_comics)Â are not only a reflection of the prevailingÂ [ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology)Â at the time ([capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism)), but that they are also aware of this, and are active agents in spreading the ideology. To do so, Disney comics use images of the everyday world:

"Here lies Disney's inventive (product of his era), rejecting the crude and explicit scheme of adventure strips, that came up at the same time. The ideological background is without any doubt the same: but Disney, not showing any open repressive force, is much more dangerous. The division between Bruce Wayne and Batman is the projection of fantasy outside the ordinary world to save it. Disney colonizes the everyday world, at hand of ordinary man and his common problems, with the analgesic of a child's imagination".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_Donald_Duck#cite_note-3)

This closeness to everyday life is so only in appearance, because the world shown in the comics, according to the thesis, is based on ideological concepts, resulting in a set ofÂ natural rulesÂ that lead to the acceptance of particular ideas aboutÂ [capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics)), theÂ [developed countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country)' relationship with theÂ [Third World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World),Â [gender roles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_role), etc.

### Publication history

How to Read Donald DuckÂ was written and published during the brief flowering ofÂ [revolutionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_socialism) socialismÂ under the government ofÂ Salvador [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Allende)AllendeÂ and hisÂ Popular [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Unity_(Chile))UnityÂ coalition and is closely identified with the revolutionary politics of its era.Â In 1973,Â [a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat) coup [](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)d'Ã©tat, secretly supported by theÂ [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), brought in power theÂ [military dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship_of_Chile_(1973%E2%80%9390))Â ofÂ [Augusto Pinochet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet). During Pinochet's regime,Â How to Read Donald DuckÂ was banned and subject toÂ [book burning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_burning); its authors were forced intoÂ [exile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile).

Outside Chile,Â HtRDDÂ became the most widely printed political text in Latin America for some time.

Project Cybersyn was a Chilean project from 1971â€“1973 during the presidency of Salvador Allende aimed at constructing a distributed decision support system to aid in the management of the national economy. The project consisted of four modules: an economic simulator, custom software to check factory performance, an operations room, and a national network of telex machines that were linked to one mainframe computer.

> A lot of Disney's popularity can be traced back to a single man: Carl Barks. Known for years as "the good duck artist"â€”for a long time, the only artist credited on Disney comics was Walt Disney himselfâ€”Barks wrote and drew around 500 comics starring Donald, his miserly Uncle Scrooge McDuck, and his three nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Some of these were short, 10-page comedy strips that appeared in Walt Disney's Comics & Stories. Others were longer, more straightforward adventure stories, most of which appeared in Barks' quarterly Uncle Scrooge seriesâ€”which just happened to be the best-selling comic book of the 1960s.

Comics historian Thomas Andrae has examined the arguments of How to Read Donald Duck and compared them to the actual Disney comic book stories by Carl Barks.[13] One of the arguments featured in the original book is that in the world of Disney no-one has to work in order to produce. The stories feature products which are bought, sold, and consumed. But they do not depict the effort needed for their production. Andrae notes that the writers seem to have identified commodity fetishism in Barks' works. The notion is that the value of products is displaced from the labor that produces them and misconceived as emanating from the products itself. The notion goes back to the works of Karl Marx.[13] Another argument in the original book is that the service sector of the economy is the one primarily depicted in Disney comics. The citizens of Duckburg are depicted working in jobs of this sector, as delivery boys, hairdressers, night watchmen, salespeople, etc. Blue-collar workers are not depicted. The writers argued that the Disney comics present as insignificant the entire realm of industrial production and the working class, despite the fact that these are the real generators of wealth in capitalist society.[13] Andrae thinks these arguments contradict the stories by Barks, where character Donald Duck himself is often featured as an underpaid and alienated worker.
